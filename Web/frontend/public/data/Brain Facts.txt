Did you know, the brain has about 86 billion nerve cells called neurons.  
Did you know, each neuron can connect to thousands of other neurons to pass messages.  
Did you know, your brain runs on about 20 watts of power—enough to light a small bulb.  
Did you know, even though it’s only about 2% of your body weight, the brain uses roughly 20% of the oxygen you breathe.  
Did you know, the brain is around 75% water, so staying hydrated helps it work well.  
Did you know, support cells (called glial cells) outnumber neurons by about 10 to 1 and keep your brain healthy.  
Did you know, new brain cells can grow in certain areas, like the memory center, even when you’re an adult.  
Did you know, signals in your brain can travel as fast as 270 miles per hour.  
Did you know, if you unfolded the outer layer of your brain (the cortex), it would cover about the same area as a large pizza.  
Did you know, your brain needs about 20% of all the calories you eat each day just to keep running.  
Did you know, it can store about 2.5 petabytes of information—that’s like saving 3 million hours of TV shows.  
Did you know, the hippocampus is the part of your brain that helps form new memories.  
Did you know, most people can hold about 5 to 9 items in their short‑term memory at once.  
Did you know, your brain is more active when you sleep (especially during dreams) than when you watch TV.  
Did you know, the left half of your brain controls the right side of your body, and the right half controls the left side.  
Did you know, laughing lights up areas in your brain that make you feel happy.  
Did you know, long‑term stress can shrink the part of your brain that manages memories.  
Did you know, the tiny blood vessels in your brain, if lined up, would circle the Earth two and a half times.  
Did you know, every time you learn something, your brain makes or strengthens connections between neurons.  
Did you know, listening to your favorite music releases “feel‑good” chemicals in your brain.  
Did you know, pain is your brain’s way of warning you something is wrong—it builds up the feeling from signals in your body.  
Did you know, people who lose a limb sometimes feel pain in the missing part because the brain expects signals that aren’t coming.  
Did you know, most of your body’s “happy” chemical (serotonin) is actually made in your gut, and it talks to your brain.  
Did you know, what looks like multitasking is really your brain switching tasks quickly—and that can make you slower overall.  
Did you know, left‑handed people often have a thicker bundle of fibers connecting the two halves of their brain.  
Did you know, “brain freeze” happens when cold food makes blood vessels in the roof of your mouth tighten and then open quickly.  
Did you know, your brain has its own cleanup team (microglia) that removes waste and fights germs.  
Did you know, neuroplasticity is your brain’s ability to reorganize itself when you learn new things or recover from injury.  
Did you know, it takes about 6 to 8 seconds from when something happens until you fully notice and react to it.  
Did you know, the balance‑and‑coordination center (cerebellum) makes up only 10% of the brain’s weight but holds over half of its neurons.
